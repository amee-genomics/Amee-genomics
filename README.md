## About Me
I am a PHD student in the UConn EEB department interested in plant adaptation to climate change. I am especially keen on using genomic technology to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying plant survival under extremely harsh environmental conditions like drought and elevated temperature. I intend to study the genomics and transcriptomics of select tree populations occuring in varied climatic conditions.
